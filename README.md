ExifReader
==========

ExifReader is a JavaScript library that parses image files and extracts the
metadata. It can also extract an embedded thumbnail. It can be used either in a
browser or from Node. Supports JPEG, TIFF, PNG, HEIC, and WebP files with Exif,
IPTC, XMP, ICC, and MPF meta data (depending on file type).

ExifReader is highly and easily configurable and the resulting bundle can be as
small as **3 KiB** (gzipped) if you're only interested in a few tags (e.g. date
and/or GPS values). See section below on
[making a custom build](#configure-a-custom-build).

ExifReader supports module formats ESM, AMD, CommonJS, and globals and can
therefore easily be used from Webpack, RequireJS, Browserify, Node etc.

You can try it out on the
[examples site](https://mattiasw.github.io/ExifReader/).

**Support table**

| File type | Exif    | IPTC    | XMP     | ICC     | MPF     | Thumbnail |
| ----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|-----------|
| JPEG      | **yes** | **yes** | **yes** | **yes** | **yes** | **yes**   |
| TIFF      | **yes** | **yes** | **yes** | **yes** | ???     | no        |
| PNG       | no      | no      | **yes** | no      | no      | no        |
| HEIC/HEIF | **yes** | no      | no      | **yes** | ???     | no        |
| WebP      | **yes** | no      | **yes** | **yes** | ???     | **yes**   |

??? = MPF may be supported in any file type using Exif since it's an Exif
extension, but it has only been tested on JPEGs.

If you're missing something that you think should be supported, file an issue
with an attached example image and I'll see what I can do.

**Notes for exif-js users**

If you come here from the popular but now dead exif-js package, please let me
know if you're missing anything from it and I will try to help you. Some notes:

-   Questions, bug reports, suggestions, and pull requests are very much
    welcome. If you've been using another Exif package you probably have some
    good insights on what's missing in this one.
-   ExifReader has a different API, hopefully better. :-)
-   XMP support in exif-js does not seem perfect. ExifReader should be a bit
    better on that part.
-   ExifReader works with strict mode.
-   I've been maintaining this package since 2012 and I have no plans to stop
    doing that anytime soon.

Support
-------

Monetary support is not necessary for me to continue working on this, but in
case you like this library and want to support its development you are very
welcome to click the button below.

</a>

Installation
------------

Easiest is through npm or Bower:

```bash
npm install exifreader --save
```

```bash
bower install exifreader --save
```

If you want to clone the git repository instead:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mattiasw/ExifReader.git
cd ExifReader
npm install
```

After that, the transpiled, concatenated and minified ES5 file will be in the
`dist` folder together with a sourcemap file.

### Type definitions

Type definitions for TypeScript are included in the package. If you're missing
any definitions for tags or something else, a pull-request would be very much
welcome since I'm not using TypeScript myself.

Usage
-----

### Importing

ES module syntax:

```javascript
import ExifReader from 'exifreader';
```

**NOTE:** TypeScript/Angular seems to sometimes have problems when using the
default export. If you're seeing issues, use this syntax instead:

```javascript
import * as ExifReader from 'exifreader';
```

CommonJS/Node modules:

```javascript
const ExifReader = require('exifreader');
```

AMD modules:

```javascript
requirejs(['/path/to/exif-reader.js'], function (ExifReader) {
    ...
});
```

`script` tag:

```html
<script src="/path/to/exif-reader.js"></script>
```

### Loading tags

There are two ways to load the tags. Either have ExifReader do the loading of
the image file, or load the file yourself first and pass in the file buffer. The
main difference is that the first one is asynchronous and the second one is
synchronous.

#### Let ExifReader load the file (asynchronous API)

```javascript
const tags = await ExifReader.load(file);
const imageDate = tags['DateTimeOriginal'].description;
const unprocessedTagValue = tags['DateTimeOriginal'].value;
```

Where `file` is one of

*  File object, the result of a form file upload (browser)
*  File path on a local file system (Node.js)
*  URL (browser or Node.js; remember that in a browser context the remote server
   has to set CORS headers that allow for remote loading of the file)

#### Load the file yourself (synchronous API)

```javascript
const tags = ExifReader.load(fileBuffer);
```

Where `fileBuffer` is one of

*  `ArrayBuffer` or `SharedArrayBuffer` (browser)
*  `Buffer` (Node.js)

See the [examples site](https://mattiasw.github.io/ExifReader/) for more
directions on how to use the library.

#### Grouping

By default, Exif, IPTC and XMP tags are grouped together. This means that if
e.g. `Orientation` exists in both Exif and XMP, the first value (Exif) will be
overwritten by the second (XMP). If you need to separate between these values,
pass in an options object with the property `expanded` set to `true`:

```javascript
const tags = ExifReader.load(fileBuffer, {expanded: true});
```

### GPS

If `expanded: true` is specified in the options, there will be a `gps` group.
This group currently contains `Latitude`, `Longitude`, and `Altitude` which will
be negative for values that are south of the equator, west of the IRM, or below
sealevel. These are often more convenient values for regular use. For some
elaboration or if you need the original values, see [Notes](#notes) below.

### Using the thumbnail

The thumbnail and its details will be accessible through `tags['Thumbnail']`.
There is information about e.g. width and height, and the thumbnail image data
is stored in `tags['Thumbnail'].image`.

How you use it is going to depend on your environment. For a web browser you can
either use the raw byte data in `tags['Thumbnail'].image` and use it the way you
want, or you can use the helper property `tags['Thumbnail'].base64` that is a
base64 representation of the image. It can be used for a data URI like this:

```javascript
const tags = ExifReader.load(fileBuffer);
imageElement.src = 'data:image/jpg;base64,' + tags['Thumbnail'].base64;
```

If you're using node, you can store it as a new file like this:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const tags = ExifReader.load(fileBuffer);
fs.writeFileSync('/path/to/new/thumbnail.jpg', Buffer.from(tags['Thumbnail'].image));
```

See the [examples site](https://mattiasw.github.io/ExifReader/) for more
details.

### Optimizing build size

The most important step will be to [use a custom
build](#configure-a-custom-build) so please do that.

If you are using Webpack and are only targeting web browsers, make sure to add
this to your Webpack config (probably the `webpack.config.js` file):

```javascript
    node: {
        Buffer: false
    }
```

`Buffer` is only used in Node.js but if Webpack sees a reference to it it will
include a `Buffer` shim for browsers. This configuration will stop Webpack from
doing that.

### Configure a custom build

Configuring a custom build can reduce the bundle size significantly.

**NOTE 1:** This functionality is in beta but should work fine. Please file an
issue if you're having problems or ideas on how to make it better.

**NOTE 2:** This only changes the built file (`exifreader/dist/exif-reader.js`),
not the source code. That means it's not possible to use the ES module (from the
`src` folder) or any tree shaking to get the benefit of a custom build. Tree
shaking will actually have close to no effect at all here so don't rely on it.

This is for npm users that use the built file. To specify what functionality you
want you can either use include pattern (start with an empty set and include) or
exclude pattern (start with full functionality and exclude). If an include
pattern is set, excludes will not be used.

For Exif and IPTC it's also possible to specify which tags you're interested in.
Those tag groups have huge dictionaries of tags and you may not be interested in
all of them. (Note that it's not possible to specify tags to exclude.)

The configuration is added to your project's `package.json` file.

**Example 1:** Only include JPEG files and Exif tags (this makes the bundle
almost half the size of the full one (non-gzipped)):

```javascript
"exifreader": {
    "include": {
        "jpeg": true,
        "exif": true
    }
}
```

**Example 2:** Only include TIFF files, and the Exif `DateTime` tag and the GPS
tags (resulting bundle will be ~16 % of a full build):

```javascript
"exifreader": {
    "include": {
        "tiff": true,
        "exif": [
            "DateTime",
            "GPSLatitude",
            "GPSLatitudeRef",
            "GPSLongitude",
            "GPSLongitudeRef",
            "GPSAltitude",
            "GPSAltitudeRef"
        ]
    }
}
```

**Example 3:** Exclude XMP tags:

```javascript
"exifreader": {
    "exclude": {
        "xmp": true
    }
}
```

Then, if you didn't install ExifReader yet, just run `npm install exifreader`.
Otherwise you have to re-build the library:

```bash
npm rebuild exifreader
```

After that the new bundle is here: `node_modules/exifreader/dist/exif-reader.js`

If you're using the include pattern config, remember to include everything you
want to use. If you want `xmp` and don't specify any file types, you will get
"Invalid image format", and if you specify `jpeg` but don't mention any tag
types no tags will be found.

Possible modules to include or exclude:

| Module      | Description                                                    |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `jpeg`      | JPEG images.                                                   |
| `tiff`      | TIFF images.                                                   |
| `png`       | PNG images.                                                    |
| `heic`      | HEIC/HEIF images.                                              |
| `webp`      | WebP images.                                                   |
| `file`      | JPEG file details: image width, height etc.                    |
| `png_file`  | PNG file details: image width, height etc.                     |
| `exif`      | Regular Exif tags. If excluded, will also exclude `mpf` and `thumbnail`. For TIFF files, excluding this will also exclude IPTC, XMP, and ICC. |
| `iptc`      | IPTC tags.                                                     |
| `xmp`       | XMP tags.                                                      |
| `icc`       | ICC color profile tags.                                        |
| `mpf`       | Multi-picture Format tags.                                     |
| `thumbnail` | Thumbnail. Needs `exif`.                                       |

Notes
-----

-   In Exif data, the full GPS information is split into two different tags for
    each direction: the coordinate value (`GPSLatitude`, `GPSLongitude`) and the
    reference value (`GPSLatitudeRef`, `GPSLongitudeRef`). Use the references to
    know whether the coordinate is north/south and east/west. Often you will see
    north and east represented as positive values, and south and west
    represented as negative values (e.g. in Google Maps). This setup is also
    used for the altitude using `GPSAltitude` and `GPSAltitudeRef` where the
    latter specifies if it's above sea level (positive) or below sea level
    (negative). If you don't want to calculate the final values yourself, see
    [the section on GPS](#gps) for pre-calculated ones.
-   Some XMP tags have processed values as descriptions. That means that e.g. an
    `Orientation` value of `3` will have `Rotate 180` in the `description`
    property. If you would like more XMP tags to have a processed description,
    please file an issue or create a pull request.
-   Some text tags use TextDecoder to decode their content. If your specific
    environment does not support it at all or a specific encoding, you will not
    be able to see the decoded value. One example is when [Node.js wasn't
    compiled with support for the specific encoding](https://nodejs.org/api/util.html#util_whatwg_supported_encodings).
-   The `description` property of tags can change in a minor update. If you
    want to process a tag's value somehow, use the `value` property to be sure
    nothing breaks between updates.

Client/Browser Support
----------------------

The library makes use of the DataView API which is supported in Chrome 9+,
Firefox 15+, Internet Explorer 10+, Edge, Safari 5.1+, Opera 12.1+. If you want
to support a browser that doesn't have DataView support, you should
probably use a polyfill like
[jDataView](https://github.com/jDataView/jDataView).

Node.js has had support for DataView since version 0.12 but ExifReader will also
try to polyfill it for versions before that (this is not well tested though).

Examples
--------

Full HTML example pages and a Node.js example are located on the
[examples site](https://mattiasw.github.io/ExifReader/).

Tips
----

-   After parsing the tags, consider deleting the MakerNote tag if you know you
    will load a lot of files and storing the tags. It can be really large for
    some manufacturers. See the
    [examples site](https://mattiasw.github.io/ExifReader/) to see how you can
    do that.
-   In some cases it can make sense to only load the beginning of the image
    file. It's unfortunately not possible to know how big the meta data will be
    in an image, but if you limit yourself to regular Exif tags you can most
    probably get by with only reading the first 128 kB. This may exclude IPTC
    and XMP metadata though (and possibly Exif too if they come in an irregular
    order) so please check if this optimization fits your use case.

Testing
-------

Testing is done with [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and
[Chai](http://chaijs.com/). Run with:

```bash
npm test
```

Test coverage can be generated like this:

```bash
npm run coverage
```

Known Limitations
-----------------

-   The descriptions for UserComment, GPSProcessingMethod and GPSAreaInformation
    are missing for other encodings than ASCII.

        numerator/denominator pair instead of being calculated into a float.
        In addition to `.value` on rational tags some descriptions have also
        changed into better ones, e.g. ExposureTime now looks like `1/200`
        instead of `0.005`.
